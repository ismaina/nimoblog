# Blog Site

Nimo's Blog is a sample test site for simulating basic CRUD with django using Django admin and django apps.

## The site
![Nimo's Blog](http://mwanjau.pythonanywhere.com/)
## Goal
The main goal is to have the site work in a monolithic structure and later decompose it to a microservice structure i.e different apps will be in different containers

## How do I plan to do that?
Familiarize myself with Containers for django and docker-compose
Use docker-swarm and kubctl to scale-up and scale-down my applications ( apps only. Db will be in one instance for now)


## What next ??
Create a NetDevops tool to configure/run tasks using django (netmiko, napalm, nornir, puppet and ansible). One will be able to configure tasks and schedule them to be executed and tests done through Jenkins.  Proposed platform will be AWS Cloud, Google Cloud, or Alicloud.
